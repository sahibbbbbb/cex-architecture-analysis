# Analysis of Centralized Exchange (CEX) Architecture

This repository contains my detailed analysis and technical breakdown of the architectural framework of Centralized Cryptocurrency Exchanges (CEXs).

## üöÄ Project Goal

The objective of this project was to move beyond surface-level understanding and deconstruct the core technical components that power high-performance trading platforms like Binance or Coinbase. As a blockchain developer, I wanted to deeply understand how these centralized systems interface with decentralized networks to serve millions of users.

## accomplishments and What I Did

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis covering the entire lifecycle of a CEX's operations. My work involved:

* **Analyzed the User Lifecycle:** Mapped the complete process from user registration and KYC verification to the management of user balances on an internal, off-chain ledger.
* **Deconstructed the Custody Model:** Investigated and documented the critical differences and interactions between Hot Wallets (for liquidity) and Cold Wallets (for security), including the automated "sweeping" mechanisms.
* **Modeled the Trading Engine:** Broke down the high-frequency, off-chain trading core, including the structure of the order book and the logic of the order matching engine.
* **Mapped the On-Chain/Off-Chain Bridge:** Detailed the precise workflows for deposits and withdrawals, explaining how a CEX translates on-chain events into internal database updates and vice versa.

The result is a comprehensive technical blueprint that explains how CEXs achieve high speed and scalability while managing security and compliance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Concepts Explored

This analysis covers the system design and core concepts of:

* **Off-Chain Ledgers:** Using centralized databases for instant, low-cost internal transactions.
* **Wallet Architecture:** The strategic use of hot and cold storage to balance security and accessibility.
* **High-Frequency Trading Systems:** The role of in-memory databases and matching algorithms.
* **Blockchain Node Interaction:** How exchanges monitor blockchains for deposits.
* **On-Chain Settlement:** The process of broadcasting withdrawal transactions from a CEX-controlled wallet.
* **Security & Compliance:** Implementation of 2FA, KYC, and AML protocols.
